## All-in-one FinApp - Unified Financial Intelligence Platform
All-in-One FinApp is a next-generation, cross-platform financial data aggregation and investment-decision assistant that runs seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

In today’s fragmented financial landscape, individuals and analysts rely on multiple disconnected apps—banking portals, brokerage dashboards, credit-card apps, and spreadsheets—to understand their full financial picture. This leads to inefficient workflows, incomplete insights, and slower investment decisions.

All-in-One FinApp eliminates this fragmentation by providing a single, secure hub where users can view, analyze, and act on their entire financial universe.

**Key Capabilities**
**1. Unified Financial Aggregation
**

Bank accounts

Credit cards

Investment portfolios

IRAs & 401(k)s

Brokerage accounts

Loans & other financial institutions

Users gain a real-time, holistic view of their finances across all providers in a single dashboard.

**2. Advanced Investment Insights & Charting**

FinApp goes beyond aggregation by offering asset-class-specific analytics, including:

Equity charts

Bond analytics

Commodity and futures charts

Options charts

It supports automated chart plotting by converting user XLS datasets into an internal API. The system highlights:
